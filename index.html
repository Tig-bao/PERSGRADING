                <br>Been a couple years, thought that id be over you

                <br>For you I prayed to god, to me you like a temple
                <br>So tell me did you love me, or did you pretend to?
                <br>Every time you touched me, was it even special?
                <br>Was I priority? Or squeezed into schedule
